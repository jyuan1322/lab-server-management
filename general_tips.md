# Bioinformatics tips from Xianjun

1. Create a folder for your project and name it properly, NOT John, my_project, 20160601, etc. (See tips here)
1. Organize data, script, result, document, etc. into separate sub-folders, not everything messed up in one folder
1. Always have a README file if you want others to understand/repeat your work.
1. Use zipped format (*.gz) whenever possible.
1. Use binary format (*.bam, *.bw) instead of raw format such as *.sam, *bedGraph;
1. Move raw sequencing files (*.fastq) to the backup disk after processing.
1. Remove intermediate or redundant files
1. Use soft link (e.g., ln -s) instead of using hard copy (e.g., cp)
